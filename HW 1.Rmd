# Problem 1 

During class you completed an activity in which you practiced `git` commands and operations (such as forking a repository, cloning it using `git clone`, and uploading changes using `git push`).

In this exercise you are asked to modify the `flpoly_student.md` file you worked during class, and format it using the **markdown** tools discussed in class. You must **create a table** that shows the courses you are currently enrolled in, using the headers: 

- Prefix: in bold letters (such as **COP**)
- Number: in bold letters (such as **2073**)
- Name: in italics (such as _Introduction to Data Science_)
- Credits (such as 3)



a. Make sure your GitHub repo (`flpoly_DS_2020/`) shows the results of your updated file (remember to use the commands `git add .` , `git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"`, and `git push`) 


| Prefix | Number  | Name                                 |Credits|
|--------|---------|--------------------------------------|:-----:|
|**COP** |**2073** |*Intro to Data Science*               |    3  |
|**STA** |**3241** |*Statistical Learning*                |    3  |
|**IDC** |**4943** |*Data Analytics Capstone 2*           |    3  |
|**CAP** |**4763** |*Time Series Modeling and Forecasting*|    3  |

|Prefix
b. Include a link to your GitHub repo in this document.

[link GitHub repo](https://github.com/rconn4554/flpoly_DS_2020)
 
c. Take a screenshot of the GitHub repo and include it in this document (you can save a copy of the screenshot file in your GitHub repo `flpoly_DS_2020/`)

# Problem 2

For this problem, you are asked to create a list of **3 concepts** you have learned about this semester, for at least 2 of the courses you are currently taking. Include the name of the course as a sub-heading (that is, using `##`), and the concepts as an unordered list. Make sure to include a link to information about the concept you listed.

## Intro to Data Science
* I learned Basic Markdown formatting.
* I also was introduced to GitHub and learned some of the basics.

## Statistical Learning
* I learned some examples and the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.

_Edit this `.Rmd` file to include the solutions here._



# Problem 3

In this problem you will practice some basic R operations. Include solutions to each items by inserting a new R chunk of code (make sure you run the chunk so that the output is displayed)

(a) Create a variable called `my_name` that contains your preferred name.
```{r}
my_name <- "Bryce Conn"
```

(b) Create a variable called `name_length` that holds how many letters are in `my_name`.
```{r}
name_length <- nchar(my_name)
print(name_length)
```


(c) Show which value is bigger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$. 
```{r}
e <- 2.71828
num1 <- e^pi
num2 <- pi^e
max(num1, num2)
```


(d) Define a function called `add_tree` that takes a single argument and returns a value 3 times larger than the input.
```{r}
add_tree <- function(x){
x=3*x
return (x)}
y <- add_tree(7)
print(y)
```

(e) Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector `v` of numbers from 10 to 49. Find the length of this vector using the `length()` function.
```{r}
v <- c(10:49)
length(v)
```


(f) Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of number from -5 to 10 in 0.5 increments.
```{r}
range <- seq(-5, 10, by = 0.5)
print(range)
```
